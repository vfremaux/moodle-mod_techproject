Featuring
=========

Techproject is a Very Complete pedagogic tool for project learning in a technical environement and
methodology. It can be used either for real project handling or just for teaching with groups of
project students.

Techproject handles and records a set of "description entities" that follows the usual IEEE project developement track : 

1 - Requirement sp√©cification and elicitaiton

2 - Product specification

3 - Realization tasks scheduled into ...

4 - Project miletones ... for making ....

5 - Deliverables that finally will be checked for recevability within ...

6 - Validation sessions

Each description entity unless Milestone and Validation session are tree-shaped and can be used for continuous 
refinement description. This will help students and teacher to drive the refinement process while making a conception, from 
a rough description to a more detailed view.

Cross linking and completion propagation
========================================

Each entity can be linked to other entities from other trees (i.e. Requirepents can be bound to specification) thus tracking coverage and 
work completion. Completion and costs indicators propagate up in the task tree and transversaly up to inital requirements to display
a full project coverage view.

Tasks can be assigned to people so individual workplans can be tracked. 

Using groups
============

The Techproject uses the Moodle course groups to separate a course audience in several project teams, each one
evoluating at his own speed in the same techproject instance. Data can be easily copied from a tree to another, or a from a gorup to another group.
